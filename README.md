...and I'm making projects in **TypeScript React**, wanting to learn and gain as much experience as much as I can in all aspects of web development, eventually churning out completed projects. My current area of interest is utilizing the **MERN Stack**. Aside from TS/JS, I've worked with **Java** quite a bit and have used C++ and Python here and there. Other than code, I'm enjoying gaming, writing as a hobby, and occasional video production on the side, always trying to learn new things.
