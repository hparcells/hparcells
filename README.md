<p align=center><strong>Currently</strong>: School for Computer Science</p>

...and I'm making projects in TypeScript React, wanting to learn as much as I can in all aspects of development while gaining experience with various libraries and platforms, eventually turning them into projects. Aside from TS/JS, I've worked with Java and have used C++ and Python here and there. Other than code, I'm enjoying gaming, writing as a hobby, and occasional video production on the side, always trying to learn new things.
